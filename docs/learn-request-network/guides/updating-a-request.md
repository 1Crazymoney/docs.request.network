# Updating a Request

After a request is created, it can be updated:

* The payee can optionally cancel the request or increase/decrease the expected amount.
* The payer can optionally accept the request, indicating that they intend to pay it.
* Both payee and payer can add 3rd party stakeholders if the request is encrypted.

Feature exists. Docs coming soon...
