# Manage Invoices

Accounting tools that implement Request Network can be used to:

* Allow the detection and payment of a request created from another accounting software
* Allow the creation of a new payment request and the detection of its status and payment

This allows users to manage the creation and payment of invoices while staying on their accounting tool.
