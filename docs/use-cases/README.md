> But.. an Invoice is just a piece of paper, no?

We created this section to give you a brief overview of the current and future use cases that could be built using the Request Network Protocol, and show you how to leverage your invoices.



## Accounting

Payment Requests living on-chain can be used for accounting purpose, as highlighted by the Request Finance product.

{% content-ref url="manage-invoices.md" %}
[manage-invoices.md](manage-invoices.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="recurring-payments.md" %}
[recurring-payments.md](recurring-payments.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

## Banking

Because invoices live on-chain, most work can be automated using smart contracts. This allows the integration of banking use cases at a lower cost, such as:

{% content-ref url="invoice-factoring.md" %}
[invoice-factoring.md](invoice-factoring.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="credit-scoring.md" %}
[credit-scoring.md](credit-scoring.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="bank-guarantee.md" %}
[bank-guarantee.md](bank-guarantee.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

## DeFi

On the Request Network protocol, a RequestNFT can be minted to represent your invoice. Whoever owns the RequestNFT is the recipient of the payment. NFTs are easely supported in DeFi. It opens up a lot of opportunity such as:

{% content-ref url="hedge-receivables.md" %}
[hedge-receivables.md](hedge-receivables.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="requestnft-as-a-collateral.md" %}
[requestnft-as-a-collateral.md](requestnft-as-a-collateral.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

## Other use-cases that require an on-chain receipt

Request Network allows you to keep track of your previous payments. This finds application for multiple use-cases such as Gaming, E-Commerce, etc. and any use case where a proof of payment is required.

{% content-ref url="proof-of-payment-gaming-e-commerce-etc..md" %}
[proof-of-payment-gaming-e-commerce-etc..md](proof-of-payment-gaming-e-commerce-etc..md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
