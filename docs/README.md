Request Network is a protocol for storing payment requests. It solves the core problem: that blockchain transactions lack context for why the transactions occurred.&#x20;

In addition to solving this core problem, it aims to:

* Break down silos of financial data
* Enable everyone to own their financial data
* Enable unprecedented use cases

Request Protocol stores the information needed by businesses to run their finances on-chain while maintaining compliance and privacy. Proving their financial activity on-chain unlocks a unique opportunity for companies to acquire income-backed services like loans, insurance, or fundraising. Moreover, it paves the way for automatic auditing, triple-entry accounting, and automatic tax reporting.

Users share payment requests securely via a standard, immutable storage medium. It enables a global cooperative financial system where people and organizations fully control their financial data and choices.

Over the past 6 years, Request Network has grown to be the largest decentralized database of payment requests. Its payment infrastructure supports a wide variety of payment types across over 20 EVM-compatible chains and NEAR.

## The ecosystem we are building

Request Network is well suited to build many types of financial applications.

Below, you can see a map of the builders we imagine that renewed transparent financial system to have, all using Request Protocol as a foundation for their users to have the privacy, security, and data ownership they deserve.&#x20;

The builders offer the protocol many transactions and new invoice data. They also provide users with fast, safe, and user-friendly payments that automatically create invoices that can be managed in builders dealing with invoicing applications.
