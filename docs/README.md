Blockchain transactions omit information necessary for accounting, compliance, and other financial services. This is a challenge for businesses that want to use blockchain technology.

Request Protocol stores the information needed by businesses to run their finances on-chain while maintaining compliance and privacy. Proving their financial activity on-chain unlocks a unique opportunity for companies to acquire income-backed services like loans, insurance, or fundraising. Moreover, it paves the way for automatic auditing, triple-entry accounting, and automatic tax reporting.

Users share payment requests securely via a standard, immutable storage medium. It enables a global cooperative financial system where people and organizations fully control their financial data and choices.

## The ecosystem we are building
