# Templates

The Request Network Templates are examples of how to integrate the Request Network Components into various web frameworks. They are "Template Repositories" in Github. The Github Docs explain how to [Create a new repository from a template repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template).

{% hint style="info" %}
The Request Network Components are built using Svelte but compiled to [Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web\_components) making them usable in any web environment, regardless of the framework.
{% endhint %}

## Request Payment (Invoicing Template)

An Invoicing Template for creating, viewing, and paying requests in Request Network. Built using the [Invoice Dashboard](components/invoice-dashboard.md) and [Create Invoice Form](components/create-invoice-form.md) Web Components.
