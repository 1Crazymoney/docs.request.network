# Request Node Gateways

To help builders get started quickly, the Request Network Foundation operates several Request Node "Gateways" that are free for anyone to use. These gateways offer endpoints for creating and retrieving requests. They also pay the protocol fee for creating requests, about USD $0.10 per request, paid in XDAI.
