# Bank Guarantee

Based on previous payments on the Request Network protocol (see [Credit Scoring](broken-reference)), an entity acting as a Bank Guarantee could support and vouch for new users.

* This will allow users to perform Invoice Factoring without a credit score
* The bank guarantee takes all the risk (for a fee) and do their due diligence (KYC, etc.)
